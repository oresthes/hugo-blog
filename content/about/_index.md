Thank you for visting! I am Orest Alickolli, and I am a data scientist based in Chicago. This blog is a diary of my journey to exploring topics in machine learning, data visualization, data engineering and more. 

I started my career as a structural engineer, but then shortly after I decided to switch to a career in data science. I am a strong believer that with the technological tools at our disposal, we will be able to massively improve the way decisions are taken and knowledge is discovered with the ultimate end of improving the wellbeing of all humanity. 

When I am not busy cursing at computer code, you can find me watching films at The Music Box, swimming, awkwardly strumming a guitar at the Old Town School of Folk Music, or regretting my last chess move.
